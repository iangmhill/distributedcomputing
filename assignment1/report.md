# Assignment 1

## Report (Task 2)

*How did you solve each challenge in task 2? Be specific, add pseudo code if you need to.*

*Did you face any other challenges? How did you solve them?
Compare the running time of your code in task 1 to that of thread 2 with a single thread. Explain
your results.*


*Calculate the running time of task 2, using a varying number of threads. Start with a single
thread, and keep increasing the number of threads till the running time doesnâ€™t change
(significantly).*


*Create a plot to represent the varying running time with increased number of threads. Explain
your results.*
